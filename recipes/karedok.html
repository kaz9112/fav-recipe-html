    <p>&emsp;Karedok is a mixture of vegetables that are combined with peanut sauce. The vegetables usually used are cabbage, bean sprouts, green round eggplant, long beans, and cucumber. Karedok can be considered as a Sundanese-style salad. Allegedly, karedok was originally a food served by the people to the regent.

    <p>&emsp;The making process and appearance of karedok looks similar to gado-gado. However, they are still different. Vegetables in gado-gado are boiled first. Unlike karedok which is served raw. But of course, the vegetables must be washed first. In addition, karedok also uses lesser galangal as the basic seasoning.
    </p>

    <p>&emsp;Apart from karedok, there is also another raw vegetable dish served. This dish from Central Java is called terancam. The difference is, terancam does not use peanut sauce, but rather coconut sauce.
